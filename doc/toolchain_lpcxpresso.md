# LPCXpresso Support in the LPC11U37/LPC1347 Codebase #

This codebase includes project files for NXP's free Eclipse-based LPCXpresso IDE, which is based on the Code Red's commercial Red Suite.  The key advantage of LPXpresso -- aside from being free for binaries up to 128KB -- is that along with the IDE, you can purchase very low-cost LPCXpresso development board that include a full on-board HW debugger.  The HW debugger can be 'cut' from the MCU half of the board, and you can then use that debugger inside the LPCXpresso IDE to program and debug any support LPC MCU, including any HW that you develop based on this code base.
